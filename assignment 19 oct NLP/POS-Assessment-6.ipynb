      "[Illustration]\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration]\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with\n",

      "\n",

      "An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying\n",
      "peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to\n",
      "the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not\n",
      "answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he\n",
      "became more and more puzzled. Presently, he came to a pond where Mr.\n",
      "McGregor filled his water-cans. A white cat was staring at some\n",
      "gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her\n",
      "tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away\n",

      "[Illustration]\n",

      "he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.\n",
      "Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently, as nothing\n",
      "happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over.\n",
      "The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions. His back was\n",
      "turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running\n",

      "black-currant bushes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not\n",
